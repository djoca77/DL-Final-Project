This project compares two models: a basic ResNet model and a ResNet model with a shared basis and orthogonal regularization term added to the calculation of the loss function. The command 'python training.py' will run the basic ResNet model and the command 'python training_shared.py' will run the shared basis and orthogonal regularization ResNet.
